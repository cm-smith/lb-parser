Executing the Program
---------------------
Input must be in the following format:

./LBBATS.sh [lbDate]

	[lbDate] - date of the leaderboard to parse in format: yyyy-mm-dd

*NOTE: if no argument is passed the program will default to today's date

Special Considerations
----------------------
In the works– if file exists, ask user if they want to proceed.
If the file exists already, it will be rewritten.

In the works– choice of target directories. 
Currently, the program requires certain target directories to 
place output files. The following are required for the program 
to execute properly:

	lb_crawler - 'res' target directory for HTML document

	lb_indexer - 's_res' target directory for score file
		     'd_res' target directory for distribution file

	lb_parser  - 'd_graphs' target directory for graph file
